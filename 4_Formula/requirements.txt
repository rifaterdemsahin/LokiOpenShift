To create a `requirements.txt` file for the `Dockerfile` provided, we need to include dependencies commonly used in Python applications. Since `main.py` is specified as the entry point, typical dependencies might include web frameworks, utilities, or database connectors. Hereâ€™s a general example, but if you know the specific packages your application requires, feel free to customize this list.

```plaintext
# Flask for web server functionality (if a web app)
Flask==2.0.3

# Requests library for HTTP requests
requests==2.26.0

# Pandas for data manipulation (optional)
pandas==1.3.4

# SQLAlchemy for database interaction (optional)
SQLAlchemy==1.4.27

# PyYAML for working with YAML files (optional)
PyYAML==5.4.1

# Gunicorn for running Flask in production (if applicable)
gunicorn==20.1.0

# Any additional dependencies your application needs
```

**Instructions**:
1. Save this content into a `requirements.txt` file in your project directory.
2. Modify this list based on the specific dependencies of your project. 

Let me know if you need help identifying any specific dependencies for `main.py`!
