Yes, you can share a GitHub Codespace with collaborators. GitHub allows you to invite collaborators to your repository, and they can then create their own codespace linked to the repository. Here are the steps to do so:

1. **Invite Collaborators to the Repository**:
   - Go to the repository on GitHub that your codespace is based on.
   - Click on the **Settings** tab.
   - Select **Collaborators and Teams** under **Access**.
   - Invite your collaborators by adding their GitHub usernames.

2. **Collaborators Create Their Own Codespace**:
   - Once they have access to the repository, they can open their own codespace from the repository by clicking the **Code** button and selecting **Create codespace**.

Unfortunately, you cannot share a single instance of a codespace for simultaneous collaboration in real-time, like in Google Docs. Each collaborator will need to create their own codespace. However, you can still collaborate effectively by pushing changes to the repository, which can be synced across everyone's codespaces.
