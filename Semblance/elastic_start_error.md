root@b640f65e1bea:/app# service elasticsearch start
Starting Elasticsearch Server:sysctl: permission denied on key "vm.max_map_count"
 failed!


 The error message you're encountering when trying to start the Elasticsearch service indicates a permissions issue related to the `vm.max_map_count` setting in your system. This setting is necessary for Elasticsearch to function correctly, as it controls the maximum number of memory maps a process may use.

Here’s how to solve this issue:

### 1. Increase `vm.max_map_count`

You need to adjust the `vm.max_map_count` setting. Here’s how you can do this:

**On a Linux-based system:**

1. **Check the Current Setting:**
   You can check the current value of `vm.max_map_count` by running:
   ```bash
   sysctl vm.max_map_count
   ```

@rifaterdemsahin ➜ /workspaces/LokiOpenShift/Symbols/Docker (main) $ docker run -it --name my-run-elastic22 myelastic:latest bash
root@55076f054757:/app#    sysctl vm.max_map_count
vm.max_map_count = 65530
root@55076f054757:/app# 




2. **Increase the Setting Temporarily:**
   You can temporarily increase the limit by running:
   ```bash
   sudo sysctl -w vm.max_map_count=262144
   ```
   This change will only last until the next reboot.

3. **Increase the Setting Permanently:**
   To make this change permanent, you need to add the following line to your `/etc/sysctl.conf` file:
   ```bash
   vm.max_map_count=262144
   ```
   After adding this line, run the following command to apply the changes:
   ```bash
   sudo sysctl -p
   ```

### 2. Running Elasticsearch with Sufficient Privileges

If you're running Elasticsearch within a Docker container or under a user with limited privileges, you may need to ensure that the container or user has the necessary permissions to modify system settings:

- **For Docker Containers:**
  If you're running Elasticsearch in a Docker container, you might need to set the `--privileged` flag or adjust your Docker settings. 

  For example:
  ```bash
  docker run --privileged -d elasticsearch:your_version
  ```

- **For System Users:**
  Ensure that you have sufficient permissions (typically root) to run the commands that affect system settings. You might need to use `sudo` if you are not running as the root user.

### 3. Start Elasticsearch Again

Once you've made the changes to `vm.max_map_count`, try starting Elasticsearch again:
```bash
sudo service elasticsearch start
```

### Additional Troubleshooting

- **Check Elasticsearch Logs:**
  If it still fails to start, check the Elasticsearch logs (usually found in `/var/log/elasticsearch/` or `/usr/share/elasticsearch/logs/`) for more specific error messages.
- **Verify Java Installation:**
  Make sure that the correct version of Java is installed and configured, as Elasticsearch depends on it.

By following these steps, you should be able to resolve the permission denied error and successfully start Elasticsearch.
