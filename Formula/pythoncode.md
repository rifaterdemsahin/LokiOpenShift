    rifaterdemsahin: why dod we need this 

GitHub Copilot: The line `if __name__ == "__main__":` is a common Python idiom used to ensure that certain code is only executed when the script is run directly, and not when it is imported as a module in another script.

Here's a breakdown of what it does:

1. **`__name__` Variable**: In Python, every module has a special built-in variable called `__name__`. When a module is run directly, `__name__` is set to `"__main__"`. However, if the module is imported into another module, `__name__` is set to the module's name.

2. **Conditional Execution**: The condition `if __name__ == "__main__":` checks whether the script is being run directly. If it is, the code block under this condition will execute.

3. **Function Call**: `Main()` is called only if the script is run directly. This is useful for running tests or executing the main functionality of the script.

### Example

Consider the following example:

```python
# mymodule.py
def Main():
    print("Hello, World!")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    Main()
```

- If you run `mymodule.py` directly, it will print "Hello, World!".
- If you import `mymodule` in another script, `Main()` will not be called automatically.

### Why is this useful?

- **Modularity**: It allows you to organize your code into reusable modules without executing the main code unintentionally.
- **Testing**: You can include test code that runs only when the script is executed directly, not when imported.

This pattern is a best practice in Python programming to ensure that code is executed in the intended context.
