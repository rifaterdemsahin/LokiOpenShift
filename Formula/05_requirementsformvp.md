# Requirements for MVP : 

## Steps to Implement

Create a java hello world application
### Use a Ready Container
1. Pull a pre-built Java Hello World container image from a container registry.
2. Run the container in your Kubernetes cluster.
3. Verify that the Java Hello World application is running correctly.

### 1. Record Logs to Loki 📜
1. Install Loki in your Kubernetes cluster.
2. Configure your Java Hello World application to send logs to Loki.
3. Verify that logs from the Java application are being recorded in Loki.

### 2. Use Loki for Application Logs
1. Set up Loki as a log source in Grafana.
2. Create dashboards in Grafana to visualize application logs from Loki.

### 3. Use Prometheus for System Logs
1. Install Promtail to collect system logs.
2. Configure Promtail to send logs to Prometheus.
3. Set up Grafana dashboards to visualize system logs from Prometheus.

### 4. Use Grafana 📊 and Prometheus 📈 to Display Metrics
1. Install Grafana and Prometheus in your Kubernetes cluster.
2. Configure Prometheus to scrape metrics from your applications.
3. Create Grafana dashboards to display these metrics.

### 5. Deploy Inside Minikube 🛠️ in Codespaces 💻
1. Set up a Minikube cluster in your Codespaces environment.
2. Deploy your applications, Loki, Prometheus, and Grafana in Minikube.
3. Verify the deployment and functionality.

### Optional: Deploy in Rancher Environment
1. Set up a Rancher-managed Kubernetes cluster.
2. Deploy your applications, Loki, Prometheus, and Grafana in the Rancher environment.
3. Verify the deployment and functionality.# Requirements for MVP
