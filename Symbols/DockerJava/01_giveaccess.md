The script `createtheprefix.sh` does not work because it lacks the necessary execution permissions. You can resolve this issue by changing the file permissions to make it executable.

To do this, run the following command:

```sh
chmod +x /workspaces/deliverypilot/SymbolsCode/createtheprefix.sh
```

After changing the permissions, you should be able to execute the script without encountering the "Permission denied" error.

```sh
/workspaces/deliverypilot/SymbolsCode/createtheprefix.sh
```
