The script `createtheprefix.sh` does not work because it lacks the necessary execution permissions. You can resolve this issue by changing the file permissions to make it executable.

To do this, run the following command:

```sh
chmod +x /workspaces/deliverypilot/SymbolsCode/createtheprefix.sh
chmod 777 /workspaces/deliverypilot/SymbolsCode/createtheprefix.sh
```

After changing the permissions, you should be able to execute the script without encountering the "Permission denied" error.

```sh
/workspaces/deliverypilot/SymbolsCode/createtheprefix.sh
```

Note: Using `chmod 777` grants all users read, write, and execute permissions, which might not be secure. It's generally better to use `chmod +x` to make the script executable by the owner only.

```sh
chmod +x /workspaces/deliverypilot/SymbolsCode/createtheprefix.sh
```
